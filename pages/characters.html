                        <p>Sandy Rivers, played by Alexis Denisof, is a recurring character in How I Met Your Mother and is known for being a television news anchor at the World Wide News channel, where he works alongside Robin Scherbatsky. Sandy is a charismatic character but also egocentric and somewhat superficial, which makes him a fun contrast to the rest of the cast.</p>

                        <p>In the series, Sandy is portrayed as a journalist who, although he has a prominent presence on screen, lacks depth in his personal and professional life. His main distinguishing feature is his uninhibited attitude and tendency to behave in an excessively self-assured manner. While he appears to have a carefree attitude, his actions often reveal his ego and desire to stand out.</p>

                        <p>One of the most memorable moments with Sandy is when he tries to court Robin, despite her lack of interest. His interest in Robin and his behavior towards her are often sources of humor, and his attempts to impress and win her favor are frequently comedic.</p>

                        <p>Sandy is also notable for his involvement in the show's plot that explores the media world and the impact of fame on people. Although his role is minor, his personality and interactions with other characters, especially Robin, add an extra layer of humor and dynamism to the show.</p>

                        <p>Jerome Whittaker, portrayed by John Lithgow, is introduced in *How I Met Your Mother* as Barney Stinson's long-lost father. Jerome, or "Jerry," first appears in the sixth season, revealing a different side of Barney's family life. Unlike the wild, womanizing figure Barney imagined his father to be, Jerry turns out to be a calm, responsible man with a loving family.</p>

                        <p>In contrast to Barneyâs extravagant and carefree lifestyle, Jerome has settled down in the suburbs, where he works as a driving instructor and enjoys a quiet, domestic life. His character represents the mature, fatherly figure Barney has always craved but never had growing up. The reunion between Barney and Jerry is both emotional and comical, as Barney grapples with his fatherâs normal, suburban life.</p>

                        <p>One of the most memorable moments with Jerome is when Barney tries to reignite his fatherâs former partying persona, only to realize that Jerry has moved on from that phase of his life. This relationship adds depth to Barneyâs character, showing his vulnerabilities and his desire for a meaningful connection with his father.</p>

                        <p>John Lithgow's performance as Jerome Whittaker brings warmth and humor to the role, making his character a significant and touching part of Barneyâs emotional journey throughout the series.</p>
